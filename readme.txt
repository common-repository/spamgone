= How does it work? =
Blog spammers usually spam for one reason only.  To leave a link on your blog.  This plugin simply removes the 'URL' field from your comments box.

If the spammer tries to send an automated POST request bypassing the comment form and it contains a URL, the plugin will detect it and immediately block the post.

There is also a setting in the plugin that will allow the plugin to block comments containing a URL in the comment body itself.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the comments-filter.zip
2. Upload the entire extracted comment-filter folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Laugh heartily as SpamGone blocks spam comments from now on :)
